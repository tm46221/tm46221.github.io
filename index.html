<h2 style="color:#FFA500;"><b>A History of the Miami Dolphins</b></h2>
<hr>
<h3 style="color:#008080;"><b>The Past</b></h3>
<p>The Dolphins joined the <abbr title="National Football League">NFL</abbr> in 1970, after the merger of the <ACRONYM>AFL</ACRONYM> and the NFL. Two short years later, they had a perfect season, the first and only ever to happen in the modern NFL. It sounds like this franchise would be in for a storied record of many successes after the early found success in this new NFL; however, you would be wrong. While they did go on to win another Super Bowl the next year, the success has yet to be repeated as they haven't won a Super Bowl title since. They went to two more after this one with one of, if not the greatest quarterback of all time in <EM>Dan Marino.</EM> Unfortunately, they did not win either. And since that 1985 Super Bowl, they haven't been back to one since. After the great head coach, <EM>Don Shula,</EM> the Dolphins have gone through head coaches like crazy. As a result of this, some bad coach named Nick Saban picked Daunte Culpepper over future Hall of Famer, Drew Brees, and as a result, set the franchise back many years. </p>

<h3 style="color:#008080;"><b>The Present</b></h3>
<p> The current coach of the Miami Dolphins is Adam Gase. He is the former offensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears. He is regarded as a quarterback whisperer and has brought out the best of quarterback Ryan Tannehill. Unfortunately, due to injuries, Gase has yet to have a full season with Tannehill; however, in games that he has him healthy, the Dolphins are 11-7. This is reason to see promise in Gase's coaching ability because without Gase, Tannehill is 29-35. The rest of the offense struggles, but this is not including the many injuries they suffer, and the lack of stability at the quarterback position. His success has earned him one playoff berth in his two years as head coach in which he clinched with backup quarterback Matt Moore. The other season was lackluster due to the poor play of quarterback Jay Cutler. Gase has brought all his players together, built a strong locker room, and certified that he is the right man to lead this offense forward into the future. </p>

<h3 style="color:#008080;"><b>The Future</b></h3>
<p> As the Dolphins look prepared to miss the playoffs again for the 14th time in 16 years, they yet again look for stability and control in the front office, at the coaching positions, and on the field. While this season continues down the toilet, and the Ryan Tannehill continues to be injury-prone it seams as if there will be a new quarterback in Davie come this Spring. 4 of the top quarterback prospects in college this year seem to be fits in the Dolphinâ€™s system: Will Grier, Justin Herbert, Drew Lock, and Dwayne Haskins. A solid quarterback prospect to sit and learn behind Tannehill and Gase for a year would do great service to the future of the franchise. As far as the other 50 spots on the team, some solid cheap free agent signings as well as some timely releases of expensive, under-performing veterans would freshen the team, make them deeper, and leading to a more rounded team worthy of a deep playoff run in 2020. </p>
